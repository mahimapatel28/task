    <h3>Lyrics</h3>
    <pre>
           Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
           Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
           Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
           Buy myself all of my favourite things, yeah
           Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
           Who would have thought it'd turn me to a savage?
           Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
           Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah
           My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
           Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
           You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
           I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it, yeah
           I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
           I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
           You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
           I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (yep)
           Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs"
           Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
           I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
           Think retail therapy my new addiction
           Whoever said money can't solve your problems
           Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
           They say, "Which one?", I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
           Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms
           My smile is beamin' (yeah), my skin is gleamin' (is gleamin')
           The way it shine, I know you've seen it (you've seen it)
           I bought a crib just for (just for) the closet (closet)
           Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah
           I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
           I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (baby)</pre>
